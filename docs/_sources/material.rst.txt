Materials in rcwa
==========================================================

The `Material` class handles materials whose material properties (permittivity, permeability, or refractive index) change as a function of wavelength. There are three primary ways to describe materials:

#. Constant numerical value
   This is the simplest model for a material - a constant permittivity
