GETTING STARTED --- 
1. Create a netlist that describes your system. This contains all the thicknesses, permittivities,
permeabilities, crystal structure, excitation wavelength/range, and so on.

SOFTWARE STATUS
Whenever possible I have attempted to stay with the convention introduced in Dr. Rumpf's online class on computational electromagnetics.

KNOWN ISSUES
When computing rTE / rTM for ellipsometry calculations, you must ensure there is some TM component to your incident wave, otherwise you will just get zero for everything.
