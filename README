SOFTWARE STATUS

Whenever possible I have attempted to stay with the convention introduced in Dr. Rumpf's online class on computational electromagnetics.

KNOWN ISSUES
When computing the quantities rx, ry, rz, there appears to be an unnecessary pi phase shift due to a difference in the TE/TM vectors. It is not clear whether this is a difference in convention or an actual error.
