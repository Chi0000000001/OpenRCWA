Title: Transfer Matrix Method Fullwave Rigorous Solver
License: BSD

This is an implementation of the Transfer Matrix Method authored by Jordan Edmunds (currently doing my Ph.D. at UC Berkeley in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department). I had previously written a simple single-polarization transfer matrix method solver in Mathematica, but am now dealing with inhomogenous, anisotropic, and nonlinear materials, and so decided to re-implement in in python under the guidance of Dr. Raymond Rumpf (no official affiliation, but I have heavily used his online lectures and available materials).

Whenever possible I have attempted to stay with the convention introduced in Dr. Rumpf's online class on computational electromagnetics.
