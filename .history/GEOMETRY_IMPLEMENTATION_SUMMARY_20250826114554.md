Summary of Phase 2.1 and 2.1+ Implementation

This document summarizes the completed implementation of ROADMAP Phase 2.1 
(Declarative Geometry Layer) and Phase 2.1+ (Parametric and Boolean Shape Support).

## Phase 2.1: Declarative Geometry Layer ✅

### Implemented Components:

1. **Shape Base Class** (`rcwa/geom/shape.py`)
   - Abstract base class for all geometric shapes
   - Supports parametric functions for all shape parameters
   - Provides containment testing, bounds calculation, and tensor function generation
   - Supports parameter sweeps with `with_params()` method

2. **Concrete Shape Classes**:
   - `Rectangle`: Axis-aligned and rotated rectangles
   - `Circle`: Simple circular shapes
   - `Ellipse`: Elliptical shapes with rotation support
   - `Polygon`: Arbitrary polygonal shapes with point-in-polygon testing
   - `RegularPolygon`: Regular n-sided polygons

3. **PatternedLayer** (`rcwa/geom/patterned.py`)
   - 2D patterned material distribution within RCWA layers
   - Maintains z-uniform assumption while supporting complex xy patterns
   - Rasterization to tensor fields for RCWA calculations
   - Convolution matrix generation for solver compatibility
   - Caching system for performance optimization

4. **Core Adapters** (`rcwa/core/adapters.py`)
   - `PatternedLayerAdapter`: Converts PatternedLayer to solver-compatible Layer objects
   - `GeometryStackAdapter`: Handles mixed stacks of regular and patterned layers
   - Validation system for conversion accuracy
   - Automatic harmonics suggestion based on pattern complexity

## Phase 2.1+: Parametric and Boolean Shape Support ✅

### Boolean Operations:
1. **UnionShape**: Union of multiple shapes (OR operation)
2. **IntersectionShape**: Intersection of shapes (AND operation)  
3. **DifferenceShape**: Subtraction of shapes (NOT operation)
4. **ComplexShape**: Base class for compound shapes
5. **Nested Operations**: Support for arbitrary nesting of boolean operations

### Parametric Support:
1. **Parametric Shape Properties**: Any shape parameter can be a function of sweep parameters
2. **Parameter Propagation**: Parameters flow from PatternedLayer to contained shapes
3. **Sweep Generation**: Easy generation of parameter sweeps for optimization/analysis
4. **Validation**: Parameter validation ensures physical validity

### Advanced Features:
1. **Tensor Material Support**: Full anisotropic material tensors (3x3 complex)
2. **High-Resolution Rasterization**: Configurable resolution with antialiasing
3. **Performance Optimization**: Caching of convolution matrices and rasterization
4. **Memory Management**: Efficient handling of large tensor fields

## Integration and Workflow

The complete workflow from geometry to solver:

```python
# 1. Create materials
substrate = Material(er=12.0, ur=1.0)
air = Material(er=1.0, ur=1.0)

# 2. Create complex geometry with boolean operations
base = Rectangle(center=(0.5, 0.5), width=0.8, height=0.8)
hole = Circle(center=(0.5, 0.5), radius=0.15)
pattern = DifferenceShape(base, [hole])

# 3. Create patterned layer
layer = PatternedLayer(
    thickness=0.22,
    lattice=((0.8, 0.0), (0.0, 0.8)),
    background_material=air,
    shapes=[(pattern, substrate)]
)

# 4. Convert for solver
harmonics = (7, 7)
converted_layer = PatternedLayerAdapter.patterned_to_layer(
    layer, harmonics, wavelength=1.5e-6
)

# 5. Use in mixed stacks
stack = [regular_layer1, layer, regular_layer2]
converted_stack = GeometryStackAdapter.convert_geometry_stack(
    stack, harmonics, wavelength=1.5e-6
)
```

## Test Coverage

Comprehensive test suite covers:
- All shape types and containment logic
- Boolean operations and nesting
- Parametric functionality and sweeps  
- PatternedLayer rasterization and convolution matrices
- Adapter integration and validation
- Complete workflow integration tests

## Performance and Scalability

- Configurable rasterization resolution (default 256x256)
- Convolution matrix caching for repeated calculations
- Memory-efficient tensor field handling
- Automatic harmonics suggestion based on pattern complexity

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain full backward compatibility with existing RCWA code:
- Regular Layer and Material classes unchanged
- Existing solver interfaces preserved
- Legacy crystal and grating support maintained

## Future Extensions

The architecture supports future enhancements:
- Additional shape types (splines, parametric curves)
- GPU acceleration for rasterization
- Adaptive mesh refinement
- Direct CAD file import
- Multi-layer pattern alignment

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Phase 2.1 and 2.1+ are fully implemented and tested. The geometry layer provides
a powerful, flexible foundation for complex RCWA simulations while maintaining
the rigorous mathematical framework required for accurate electromagnetic modeling.
