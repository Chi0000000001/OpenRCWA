# This is a test sample netlist which I will attempt to keep consistent with

# This is a plane-wave source of infinite extent, with angle theta and phi specified in degrees.
# The last two numbers are the TE / TM polarization numbers. They will be normalized internally, only
# their ratio matters.

L0 1.0 1.0 # This is layer 0. There must always be a layer zero (the semi-infinite media from which
            # we are sending our excitation
# This is layer 1. It has relative permittivity 9.0 and relative permeability 1.0. All
# intermediate layers must have a thickness, which can be specified in real units (nm, um, mm)
# or left as the default (if no units, microns are assumed)
